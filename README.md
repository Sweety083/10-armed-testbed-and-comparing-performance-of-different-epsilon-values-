# Reinforcement Learning: Task 1 & Task 2

This repository contains two foundational tasks exploring key concepts in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, implemented using Python and OpenAI Gym. These tasks provide hands-on experience with environment interaction, reward optimization, and policy learning.

## 📌 Contents

- `RL_T1&T2.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook that includes:
  - **Task 1**: Interaction with a basic RL environment (e.g., FrozenLake, CartPole, or similar).
  - **Task 2**: Implementation and evaluation of RL algorithms such as Q-Learning or SARSA.

## 🚀 Features

- Environment simulation using **OpenAI Gym**
- Exploration vs Exploitation techniques
- Q-table generation and updating
- Reward tracking and performance visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning for better learning performance

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib gym
